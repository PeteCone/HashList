/**
 * The IPAddress is using iIPv4 and has dotted-decimal notation, with the network, two subnets, 
 * and host separated by periods. For example, the IP address 130.191.226.146 has 
 * a network of 130, a subnet of 191, the second subnet is 226, and the host address is 146.
 * 
 * Your IPAddress class should accept a string of dotted-decimal IPAddresses in the constructor
 * and separate them into the components. 
 *
 * Note: The templates for some methods have been provided, but you should consider which additional
 * methods to add to this class.
